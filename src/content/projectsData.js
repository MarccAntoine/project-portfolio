I designed and developed this website entirely on my own within a two-week timeframe, based on an idea I had a few months ago. I constructed a database, backend, and frontend, leveraging the knowledge and languages I acquired during my studies. Additionally, I incorporated new technologies such as Auth0 for user authentication and the Spoonacular API to enhance the project's functionalities. Users have the ability to manage their food inventories by adding, editing, and deleting products. They can also keep track of expiry dates, create weekly meal plans, discover and add new recipes, and compile their grocery lists.", name: "FoodFlow - kitchen organisation", id: "foodflow", git: "https://github.com/MarccAntoine/Final-Project", youtube : "https://youtu.be/rZgoNrJCjHs"},

We built the database, server, and front-end from an initial array of products provided by the bootcamp. To complete this project, I worked in collaboration with my teammates to connect everything together. I personally took charge of organizing and planning the endpoints. I then worked on some of those endpoints and part of the front-end. I also created the cart system to add/update products and place transactions using the useContext hook from React, as per the project's guidelines.", name: "E-commerce Website", id: "ecomm"},

My teammate and I were provided with a server already equipped with completed endpoints for data retrieval. We constructed the entire frontend using REACT and JavaScript, aligning it with the project's technical requirements and user interface expectations. The website is fully navigable on both mobile and desktop devices, allowing users to interact with tweets by adding likes and retweets, as well as engaging with profiles through follow/unfollow actions.", name: "Twitter Clone", id: "twitter"}
