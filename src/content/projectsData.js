This website was entirely built by myself in two weeks from an idea I've had a few months ago. I built a database, backend and frontend using all notions and languages I learned during my studies, and additionally some new technologies, like Auth0 to take care of user's authentication and spoonacular API to maximize functionalities in my project. Users can manage their food inventories, by adding/editing and deleting products, keep track of expiry dates, build weekly meal plans, add recipes and search for new recipes and build their grocery list.", name: "FoodFlow - kitchen organisation", id: "foodflow", git: "https://github.com/MarccAntoine/Final-Project", youtube : "https://youtu.be/rZgoNrJCjHs"},

We built the database, server and front-end from an initial array of products provided by the bootcamp. To complete this project, I worked in collaboration with my teammates to connect everything together. I personally took charge of organizing and planning the endpoints, I then worked on some of those endpoints and part of the front-end. I also created the cart system, to add/update product and place transactions using the useContext hook from React as per the project's guideline.", name: "E-commerce Website", id: "ecomm"},

Me and my teammate were given a server with already completed endpoints to fetch the data. We built the entire front-end using REACT and Javascript according to our client's, technically the project's , expectations and user interface. It is possible to navigate on the website, both on mobile and computer, interact with the tweets by adding likes/retweets and interact with the profiles by following/unfollowing them.", name: "Twitter Clone", id: "twitter"}
